# Overview

The **Mobile Robotic Manipulator** is a self-designed robotics platform that integrates a six-wheel mobile robot with a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm into a single modular system. The project focuses on embedded systems, wireless communication, robotic manipulation, and autonomous mobile robotics.

Every subsystem—including the mechanical assembly, electronics integration, embedded firmware, communication protocols, documentation, and testing—has been developed from the ground up as part of a continuous engineering project.
